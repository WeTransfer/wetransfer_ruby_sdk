## Installation

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

### Minimalist transfers

You'll need to retrieve an API key from [our developer portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com).

Be sure to not commit this key to Github! If you do though, no worries, you can always revoke & create a new key from within the portal.

For configuring and storing secrets - like this API key - there are a variety of solutions. The smoothest here is creating a .env file:

Now that you've got a wonderful WeTransfer API key, create a .env file in your project folder:

    $ touch .env

Check your `.gitignore` file and make sure it has `.env` listed!

Now, open the file in your text editor and add this line:

`WT_API_KEY=<your api key>` (without the <> brackets!)

Great! Now you can go to your project file and create the client:

```ruby
# In your project file:
require 'we_transfer_client'

@client = WeTransferClient.new(api_key: ENV.fetch('WT_API_KEY'))
```

Now that you've got the client set up you can use `create_transfer` to, well, create a transfer!

```ruby
transfer = @client.create_transfer(name: "My wonderful transfer", description: "I'm so excited to share this") do |upload|
  upload.add_file_at(path: '/path/to/local/file.jpg')
  upload.add_file_at(path: '/path/to/another/local/file.jpg')
  upload.add_file(name: 'README.txt', io: StringIO.new("This is the contents of the file"))
  upload.add_web_url(url: "https://www.the.url.you.want.to.share.com", title: "title of the url"))
end

transfer.shortened_url => "https://we.tl/SSBsb3ZlIHJ1Ynk="
```

The upload will be performed at the end of the block.

#### Manual transfers

Manual uploads are possible by passing `manual_uploads` keyword arguments and setting the value to `true`. This prevents the automatic chunking and uploading of the files. This makes it possible to upload "big" files from your server in a more async way.


It's also possible to create an empty transfer first and add files to it later.

First create an itemless transfer:

```ruby
transfer = @client.create_transfer(name: 'Manual Transfer', description: 'I have to upload the files on my own')
```

Then use the previous created transfer for the `transfer` keyword argument. In this option you can either upload the items yourself by setting the `manual_upload` value to `true` or let be processed automaticaly.

```ruby
updated_transfer = @client.add_items_to(transfer: transfer, manual_upload: true) do |upload|
  upload.add_file_at(path: '/path/to/local/file.jpg')
  upload.add_file_at(path: '/path/to/another/local/file.jpg')
  upload.add_file(name: 'README.txt', io: StringIO.new("This is the contents of the file"))
  upload.add_web_url(url: "https://www.the.url.you.want.to.share.com", title: "title of the url"))
end

```

The update_transfer reponse is a `Struct` and looks like this:
```ruby
#<struct RemoteTransfer
 id="htahsadn717321701308",
 version_identifier=nil,
 state="processing",
 shortened_url="https://we.tl/s-stysd8dnC",
 name="Example Transfer",
 description="Test transfer for example",
 size=20971750,
 items=
  [#<struct RemoteItem
    id="tyfc2uougsvkot9732167971235",
    local_identifier="2f2a6f85-8cc4-49fd",
    content_identifier="file",
    name="file.bin",
    size=20971750,
    mime_type=nil,
    upload_url=
     "https://wetransfer-eu-prod-spaceship.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/htahsadn717321701308/tyfc2uougsvkot9732167971235?partNumber=1&uploadId=XGv",
    title=nil,
    upload_id="XGvFClR4WacI434US",
    meta=
     {:multipart_parts=>4,
      :multipart_upload_id=>"XGvFClR4WacI434U.F1hMUwr.IruAJ"

      }
    >]
```

After Initializing the transfer you have to get the upload urls for each part. The `create_transfer` or `add_items_to` response tells you how many parts it expects. Parts are calculated on 6MB chunks (e.q. 60MB is 10 parts and 32MB is 6 parts).

The `request_item_upload_url` methods expects two keyword arguments, `item(Struct)` and `part_number(Integer)`.

```ruby
@client.request_item_upload_url(item: updated_transfer.items.first, part_number: 2)

```

The response looks like this:

```json
 {:upload_url=>
  "https://wetransfer-eu-prod-spaceship.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/htahsadn717321701308/tyfc2uougsvkot9732167971235?partNumber=1&uploadId=XGvFClR4WacI434U.F1hMUwr.IruAJaVFfeShbayEMOdGs.",
 :part_number=>1,
 :upload_id=>
  "XGvFClR4WacI434U.F1hMUwr.IruAJaVFfeShbayEMOdGs",
 :upload_expires_at=>1532966650
 }
```

Do this request for the required amount of parts as mentioned in the `add_items_to` or `create_transfer` response.

After uploading the file, you have to complete the file. This is needed for AWS to know all the parts are there and need to be glued together. Call the `complete_item!` with the keyword argument `item_id(String)` and pass on the the `id` from the item you've uploaded. The response message will tell you `File is marked as complete` if done right.

Example:

```ruby
@client.complete_item!(item_id: updated_transfer.items.first.id)

```


## Development
You'll need to retrieve an API key from [our developer portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com), and as described above, store it in a local `.env` file. As always, do not commit this file to github! :)

After forking and cloning down the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```
$ git clone <your fork>
$ cd wetransfer_ruby_sdk
$ bundle install
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To execute to ruby specs, run:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

Please note that we use rubocop to lint this gem -- be sure to run it prior to submitting a PR for maximum mergeability.

    $ bundle exec rubocop

If any violations can be handled by rubocop, you can run auto-fix and it'll handle them for you, though do run the tests again and make sure it hasn't done something ... unexpected.

    $ bundle exec rubocop -a

Hooray!
